# Priority areas to protect mangroves and maximise ecosystem benefits

In this repository is reported the code to run the prioritisation and produce the figures of the study "Priority areas to protect mangroves and maximise ecosystem benefits". 

The code should be run sequentially.

Data to run the code in 01_PrepareLayers.R can be downloaded at:
- Global Mangrove Watch (https://www.globalmangrovewatch.org/)
- Aboveground carbon (Simard et al., 2019) (https://daac.ornl.gov/cgi-bin/dsviewer.pl?ds_id=1665)
- Soil carbon (Sanderman et al., 2018) (https://zenodo.org/record/1469348#.Yv9HDcJBy3A)
- Coastal protection (Menéndez et al. 2020) (https://osf.io/ecs4p/)
- Fishing intensity (Zu Ermgassen et al., 2021) → not publicly available

Data to run the code starting from 02_Prioritisation.R are provided as RDS.
